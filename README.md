# One more DOOM

One more clone of the classic Doom. Just for fun and with respect to the creators.
The main goal is to create a game engine that can use original WAD files. This task
requires to use ideas and small parts of the original DOOM code. Here is the original repository:

Now the project is on the stage of reverse engineering, so the code and architecture in general are
far from ideal. When all basic features have been explored, the project will be refactored.
