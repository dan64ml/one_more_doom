Hi! It's a site about my pet project: One more DOOM. It's a clone of the classical DOOM by id Software.
The project is supposed to use original WAD files and don't use any GPU features. Only software rendering.

You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/dan64ml/one_more_doom).
Also here is the project blog: [Blog](https://dan64ml.github.io/one_more_doom/blog.html).

Below I posted some demo videos showing the current state of the project. I'll update these videos as the project progresses.
