Since the previous post I added many new features and fixed some issues. First of all, several types of
monsters got AI. Zombiemen, cacodemons, shotguys, mancubuses and imps are now fully functional. Sound
propagation is the only unrealised stuff, but it's connected with the world logic, not AI.

Vertical moving logic was changed and now floating mobjs have the right behavior. Also player now moves
correctly when jumping. It makes it possible, for example, to open a secret on map 01.

Taking damage, all mobjs now get thrust according their mass and damage... I updated the videos on the main page,
you can see many changes there...
