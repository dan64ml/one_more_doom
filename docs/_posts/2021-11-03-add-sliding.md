title:  "Player can slide along walls"

Before now player stopped every time when he met a wall. It looked bad and made the movement unnatural.
I've added sliding and now player starts sliding along the wall when meets it. Player still ignores monsters
and other objects on the map. It makes debugging much easier and will be fixed later. For the same reason
player has no inertia.
